## Usage
```cargo run -- -u <up> -d <down> -f <filename>```
up = upslope in seconds, default 2.0
down = downslope in second, default 2.0
filename = filename to store values in csv format, default allpoints-csv.csv

Total time is 10 seconds, so the flat time is 10 minus the upslope and the downslope. 
In the repo the results for 2.0/2.0  and 2.5/2.5 are given
